# Synthetic Nostos: A Critical Case Study on Emotional Noise in Generative AI

This project investigates the limitations of current Generative AI models (such as Midjourney/DALL-E) in encoding and reproducing **subjective emotional experience**. It challenges the assumption that visual perfection is equivalent to emotional truth.

## 1. Core Problem: Emotional Noise as Missing Data

* **Hypothesis:** AI successfully replicates the *aesthetics* of memory but consistently fails to encode the emotional *pain* (the 'Algos') that defines true nostalgia. This gap is defined as **Emotional Noise**.
* **Background:** The research uses a critical perspective informed by Information Systems Engineering principles to examine the system's output failures and data bias.

## 2. Methodology: The 5 Axes of Testing

The study was structured around five methodological axes designed to stress-test the model's subjective capacity:

1.  **Avoidance of Keywords:** Testing the AI's ability to infer emotion from context.
2.  **Sensory Noise Insertion:** Introducing non-visual cues (texture, silence, taste) to challenge the visual-centric dataset.
3.  **Visualization of Undescribable Feelings:** Testing the encoding of abstract states like 'absence' or 'waiting.'
4.  **Specific Timestamp Challenge:** Forcing the AI to synthesize details beyond generalized datasets.
5.  **Defying Technical Perfection:** Deliberately requesting artifacts like 'glitch' or 'low fidelity' to test the model's bias towards flawless output.

## 3. Findings and Conclusion

The experiments confirmed that **technical visual noise is not equivalent to emotional noise**. The AI simulated the *look* of memory loss, but did not capture the *feeling* of personal loss. This underscores the need for new approaches to data ethics and the encoding of subjective human experience.
